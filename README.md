# neural-network
This project is mostly dropped, although I might come back to it once in a while. Check out the testing branch for updates.
If you run the main function in Testing.java, you can see that the cost actually increases after training, which is obviously the opposite of what we want.
So this basically doesn't work at all, but feel free to reference my code at your project's own risk.
